    ### Page and Table viewing

    Scenario: User must be able to navigate to the Objective template under the Syntax Template Library
        Given The '/library' page is opened
        When The 'Objective Templates' submenu is clicked in the 'Syntax Templates' section
        Then The current URL is '/library/objective_templates'

    Scenario: User must be able to see the Parent Objective template table with listed columns
        Given The '/library/objective_templates' page is opened
        And A table is visible with following headers
            | headers                |
            | Sequence number        |
            | Indication or disorder |
            | Objective category     |
            | Confirmatory testing   |

            | Status                 |
            | Version                |
    #### NOTES:
    # The sequence number reflect the creation order of Objective Parent Templates
    # As some columns are very text intensive, we suggest some columns by default is hidden
    # Any user preferences will however overrule the default column display

    Scenario: User must be able to see the list of Pre-instance Objective Templates on the main page with options listed
        Given The '/library/objective_templates' page is opened
        When The 'Pre-instance Templates' tab is selected
        And A table is visible with following headers
            | headers                   |
            | Sequence number           |
            | Indication or disorder    |
            | Objective category        |
            | Confirmatory testing      |

            | Version                   |
    #### NOTES:
    # The sequence number reflect the creation order of Objective Pre-instance templates by Parent Template
    # As some columns are very text intensive, we suggest some columns by default is hidden
    # Any user preferences will however overrule the default column display

    Scenario: User must be able to see the list of User Defined Objective Templates on the main page with options listed
        Given The '/library/objective_templates' page is opened
        When The 'User Defined Templates' tab is selected
        Then A table is visible with following headers
            | headers     |
            | Template    |
            | Modified    |
            | Modified by |
    #### NOTES:
    # User Defined Templates are created at study level, the distinct templates can be displayed here
    # Under Template Instantiations the usage on studies can be seen.

    ### Sequence number generation
    ### NOTE, these scenarios could be tested as part of API testing
    @pending_implementation @api_test
    Scenario: System must generated sequence number for Objective Parent Templates when they are created
        Given an Objective Parent Template is created
        # This could be with a reference to the API POST Endpoint and a following API GET Endpoint - or just formulated as a functional requrement
        Then the attribute for 'Sequence number' will hold an automatic generated number as 'OT'+[Order of Objective Parent Template]

    @pending_implementation @api_test
    Scenario: System must generated sequence number for Objective Pre-instance Templates when they are created
        Given an Objective Pre-instance Template is created
        Then the attribute for 'Sequence number' will hold an automatic generated number as 'OT'+[Order of Objective Parent Template]+'-OP'+[Order of Pre-instantiation]

    ### Display controls
    ### NOTE, currently postponed - to be assessed if needed later
    #
    #   Scenario: User must be able to see a combined column of either the parent syntax template text or the pre-instantiation text
    #       Given The '/library/objective_templates' page is opened on the 'Sponsor Standards' tab
    #       And a table display the Objective Parent and Pre-instantiation Templates
    #       Then the column 'Template' will show the Parent Template text for Objective Template Syntax Templates rows
    #       And the column 'Template' will show the Pre-instantiation text for Pre-instantiations rows of the Syntax Template
    #   # 'Parent Template' is name property on the SyntaxTemplateValue node
    #   # 'Pre-instantiation' is name property on the SyntacPreInstanceValue node
    #
    #   Scenario: User must be able to see both Parents and related Pre-instantiations of the Objective Syntax Templates
    #       Given The '/library/objective_templates' page is opened on the 'Sponsor Standards' tab
    #       And a table display the Objective Templates
    #       When the user enable the display of the Pre-instantiation control
    #       Then rows for both Objective Parent and related Pre-instantiations is displayed
    #
    #   Scenario: User must be able to only see Parents of the Objective Syntax Templates
    #       Given The '/library/objective_templates' page is opened on the 'Sponsor Standards' tab
    #       And a table display the Objective Templates
    #       When the user disable the Display Pre-instantiation control
    #       Then only rows for Objective Parent Templates is displayed
