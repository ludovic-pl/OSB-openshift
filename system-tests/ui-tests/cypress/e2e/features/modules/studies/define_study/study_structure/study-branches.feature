    As a system user,
    I want the system to ensure [Scenario],
    So that I can make complete and consistent specification of study branch arms.

    Background: User is logged in
        Given The user is logged in

    Scenario: User must be able to navigate to Study Branches page using side menu
        Given A test study is selected
        Given The '/studies' page is opened
        When The 'Study Structure' submenu is clicked in the 'Define Study' section
        And The 'Study Branches' tab is selected
        Then The current URL is 'studies/Study_000001/study_structure/branches'

    Scenario: User must be able to see the Study Branches table with options listed in this scenario
        Given A test study is selected
        Given The '/studies/Study_000001/study_structure/branches' page is opened

        Given a Study Arm has been defined for the study
        And only one Study Branch Arm exist related to this Study Arm
        And the Study Branch Arm have Study Design Cell relationships to Study Elements for a Study Epochs
