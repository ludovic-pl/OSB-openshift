This file holds shared notes for study visits.   
   
   We have 4 classess of visits
   - 'Scheduled visits'
   - 'Unscheduled visits'
   - 'Non-visits'
   - 'Special visit'
   - 'Manual visits'
   # The previously defined insertion visits is identical to manually defined visits - so these are redefined to be manually defined visits.

   For 'Scheduled visits' we have the following sub classes (sub types):
   - 'Single visits'
   - 'Anchor visit in visit group'
   - 'Additional sub-visit'
   - 'Repeating visits'

   Automatic naming and numbering notes:
     Only study visits defined as scheduled visits will have automatic visit numbering derived, and only these study scheduled visits will be included when deriving the numbering.
     The visit number is derived as an running integer with 1 for the very first visit sorted by chronological order (i.e. 1, 2. 3, 4, etc.).
     Exception is if the initial visit is an information visit, then it will be numbered as visit 0.
     The unique visit number for single visits is derived as an integer with 100 for the very first visit, increasing with +100 for each single visit, sorted by chronological order (i.e., 100, 200. 300, etc.).

     The sub visit will however keep the visit number from the visit initiating the sequence of sub visits.
     The unique visit number for sub visits will be derived as an integer from the visit initiating the sequence of sub visits +10 (if less than 10 sub visits), alternative + 5, sorted by chronological order (i.e., 310, 320, 330, etc.).

     Study visits defined not to have automatic visit numbering must have the visit numbering specified manually.

     Study visits defined as class:
     - 'Unscheduled visits'
     - 'Non-visits'
     Will get a fixed name and numbers.


   Automatic visit time notes:
     Only study visits defined as scheduled visits will be at a specific point in time will get the time point calculated.
     Scheduled study visits can have their time reference defined with a time reference to:
      - Global anchor visit
      - Note Global anchor visit also exist as term in the Time Reference sponsor codelist
     - Time reference visit (any visit defined with a visit type also being a time reference)
     - Anchor visit in visit group (but only applicable and required for the sub-visits in the sequence)
     - Previous visit
    
   Manually defined visists will have the time points specified manually.
   Unscheduled visits and non-visits cannot have any study time defined.

   Manual visit notes:
   
     Manual visits is made so they will not impact existing visit names and numbering.
     Note, the Manual visits can represent scheduled visits, but these are named and numbered manually are not following the name and numbering rules - but vaulues still need to be unique.
     We also have the possibility for manual numbering - the manually defined visits will have a manually defined visit number, and these are not included in the logic for automatic numbering.
     The system will however check for uniqueness on the visit numbers defined manually or automatically - so some updates might be stopped by the API due to these constraints.
